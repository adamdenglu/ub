Unbiased Estimation of the Gradient of the Log-Likelihood in Inverse Problems
==
This is the implementation for our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04896).

Installation and Remarks
--
* Install the package smccbase14_0.1.0.tar.gz in R before running code.
* Create a folder named MC to store data and results.
* Main file is ub_mlsmc.r. You can change some settings in this file.
* The codes contain MLSMC, four types of unbiased estimator and stochastic gradient descent using unbiased estimator.
